# Fraud Protection, Rate Limiting

All API requests should include the client IP address if possible. If not
provided, the IP of the machine making the request will be used. This value is
used for rate limiting, fraud protection, etc. To prevent the same fraudster
from attempting to signup for your service over and over and over again with
different credit card numbers, you'll need to provide the IP address with the
request.
