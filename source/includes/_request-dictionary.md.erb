  If the plan is free, only <code>code</code>, <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>email</code> and
  <code>subscription[planCode]</code> are required. If the plan is a paid plan, credit card
  information is only required if you have configured <%= config[:general_name] %> to require it.
  It can be optional only if the first invoice on a pricing plan is delayed. If a
  subscription on a paid plan does not have a payment method when it comes time to
  bill, the subscription will be auto-cancelled. See the the email templates
  <a href="<%= config[:support_url] %>/kb/operational-how-tos/email-notification-templates">KB Article</a>
  regarding free trials and the <em>Bill Reminder</em> email.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<p>
  When using $0.00 verification transactions (e.g., <code>Authorize.Net CIM validationMode=liveMode)</code>
  for credit card pre-verifications, <code>subscription[ccAddress]</code> and
  <code>subscription[ccZip]</code> are required.
</p>

<p>
    If pre-tokenized payment methods are available, you may create a new
    customer with a payment method by providing a
    <code>subscription[gatewayToken]</code>,
    <code>subscription[ccType]</code>,
    and <code>subscription[ccLastFour]</code>
    values instead of
    <code>subscription[ccNumber]</code>
    and <code>subscription[ccCardCode]</code>.
    This feature is compatible with only some back-end billing solutions.
    In some cases, only the <code>subscription[gatewayToken]</code> is
    required as the additional data is subsequently requested from the
    upstream gateway. In that case, params passed in the request will
    override/update the the upstream gateway.
</p>

<p>
  Charges are not required but when including charges, <code>chargeCode</code>,
   <code>quantity</code> and <code>eachAmount</code> are required for each charge.
</p>

  If the customer does not already have a subscription with a valid credit card,
  all credit card information is required. If the plan code corresponds to a
  "free" plan, no Credit Card data is required. If the customer already has a
  subscription with a credit card, no credit card information data is required.
  In this instance, any subset of credit card data may be provided.
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  If the plan is a paid plan, credit card information is only required if you
  have configured <%= config[:general_name] %> to require it. It can be optional only if the
  next invoice is delayed. If a subscription on a paid plan does not have a
  credit card when it comes time to bill, the subscription will be auto-cancelled.

<p>
    If pre-tokenized payment methods are available, you may create a new
    customer with a payment method by providing a
    <code>subscription[gatewayToken]</code>,
    <code>subscription[ccType]</code>,
    and <code>subscription[ccLastFour]</code>
    values instead of
    <code>subscription[ccNumber]</code>
    and <code>subscription[ccCardCode]</code>.
    This feature is compatible with only some back-end billing solutions.
    In some cases, only the <code>subscription[gatewayToken]</code> is
    required as the additional data is subsequently requested from the
    upstream gateway. In that case, params passed in the request will
    override/update the the upstream gateway.
</p>

<p>
  Changing the next bill date using <code>subscription[changeBillDate]</code>
  effects the billing cycle. Subsequent bill dates will be on the new cycle.
  In other words, for a monthly plan that typically bills on the 3rd of every
  month, if the next bill date is changed to the 10th, the subscription will
  now bill every month on the 10th. If the date is equal to 'now' or is less
  than or equal to the current date and time, the current invoice will be
  executed in real-time.

## Tracked Items

Use the tracked item endpoints to *set*, *increment*, or *decrement* the quantity of
and item for an individual subscription.

[Learn more about using Tracked Items in the Knowledge Base](<%= config[:support_url] %>/kb/pricing-plans/pricing-plan-basics#tracked-items)

**Note:** Updates of item quantities on <em>canceled subscriptions</em> are only possible under a few circumstances:

* The cancellation is the special <code>paypal-wait</code> state and the PayPal preapproval request period is still valid (up to 3 hours)
* The canceled subscription has a pending invoice with a billingDatetime in the future
* The quantity update request is for the outstanding invoice. The request includes the `invoicePeriod` parameter and it is set to `outstanding`

`remoteAddress` | **Not Required ([see below](#fraud-protection-rate-limiting))** Client IPv4 address

<aside class="notice">
  The customer must have an outstanding invoice. This method can be useful for
  manually retrying the transaction on an outstanding invoice. An invoice may
  be outstanding if all prior attempts to transact the invoice were unsuccessful
  or if the invoice has not yet been attempted as with the <a href="<%= config[:support_url] %>/kb/api-8/web-hooks-service-hooks-and-captain-hooks#subscription-billable">
  Subscription Billable Event
  </a>.

    This method can be used to reactivate a canceled subscription. If the retry
    succeeds on a canceled subscription, the subscription is reactivated. You
    can also add credits to the invoice to offset charges, making the invoice
    amount = 0. In this case, executing that outstanding invoice will succeed
    for a zero amount and reactivate the subscription.

### Issue a Refund

Refund a transaction on a billed invoice in the product with `productCode=MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

`/invoices/refund/productCode/MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`number` or `id `| **Required** Either <%= config[:general_name] %>'s ID for the invoice or the <%= config[:general_name] %>-generated invoice number
`amount` | **Required** An amount less than or equal to the refundable amount. See notes.
`remoteAddress` | **Not Required ([see below](#fraud-protection-rate-limiting))** Client IPv4 address

<aside class="notice">
  Many billing solutions allow for partial refunds. If your billing solution
  allows partial refunds, the amount may be less than the amount of the original
  transaction. If the transaction had been previously refunded and you wish to
  issue another refund, the amount must be less than or equal to the original
  amount minus any previously issued partial refund amounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Some billing solutions allow for refunds prior to transaction settlement.
    If your billing solution does not allow refunds prior to settlement, you
    must execute a void of the full transaction or wait until after settlement
    occurs to issue a refund.
  </p>
</aside>

### Issue a Void

Void a transaction on a billed invoice in the product with `productCode=MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

`/invoices/void/productCode/MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`number` or `id` | **Required** Either <%= config[:general_name] %>'s ID for the invoice or the <%= config[:general_name] %>-generated invoice number
`remoteAddress` | **Not Required ([see below](#fraud-protection-rate-limiting))** lient IPv4 address

<aside class="notice">
  Some billing solutions allow for voids. If your billing solution allows
  voids, a void can only be executed prior to transaction settlement.

### Issue a Void or Refund

Defer to <%= config[:general_name] %> to decide if a void or a refund is executed against
the invoice in the product with  `productCode=MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

`/invoices/void-or-refund/productCode/MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`number` or `id` | **Required** Either <%= config[:general_name] %>'s ID for the invoice or the <%= config[:general_name] %>-generated invoice number
`remoteAddress` | **Not Required ([see below](#fraud-protection-rate-limiting))** Client IPv4 address

<aside class="notice">
  Many billing solutions do not allow for voids. Voids are only possible for a
  short period of time after the transaction is executed. In short, determining
  whether to execute a void or a refund is a moving target. Fortunately, <%= config[:general_name] %>
  has already figured that out. Using this call makes voids and refunds simple.
  A drawback of using this method is that partial refunds are not possible.

Send (or resend) email notification for the invoice in the product
with  `productCode=MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

`/invoices/send-email/productCode/MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

    Emails are automatically sent but if you'd like to resend one, just use this
    method. The most recent relevant email will be sent for the invoice. For
    example, if the most recent transaction was declined, the decline email is
    sent. If that most recent transaction was approved, the payment receipt email
    is sent.
