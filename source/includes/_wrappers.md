# Open Source Wrappers

The CheddarGetter API can be leveraged by any programming language. All publicly
available code libraries will be made available as they are created. Discussion
of these code libraries is welcomed in the CheddarGetter API Discussion Forum.
Please visit [the support forum](http://support.cheddargetter.com/)
for more information.

## Ruby

The officially supported gem from Michael at [ExpectedBehavior](http://www.expectedbehavior.com/).
The ExpectedBehavior gem fully implements the API and includes 100% test coverage.
[Check out the docs](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cheddargetter_client_ruby).

## PHP

The PHP CheddarGetter Client is a wrapper for the CheddarGetter API provided and
supported by the CheddarGetter team.  There's a nice
[Quick Start Guide](http://support.cheddargetter.com/kb/api-8/php-client-library-quick-start).
This ZF-compatible library is provided as an open source repository via GitHub
here:
