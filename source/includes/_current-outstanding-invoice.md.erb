# Current vs. Outstanding Invoice

Many API calls interact with a customer's subscription invoice. The "current"
subscription invoice is the one that is currently "open". In other words, it is
scheduled to bill in the future. You can add charges, credits, and item
quantities to a subscription invoice. In almost every case, you'll want to
interact with the "current" subscription invoice. This is the default for all
relevant API calls. In rare cases, you might want to adjust the "outstanding"
subscription invoice.

An outstanding invoice is one that was scheduled to bill in the past but has
not yet been paid. This could be a scheduled invoice that was attempted but
declined (the subscriber is in the dunning process) or simply one that's
scheduled in the past but <%= config[:general_name] %>'s recurring engine hasn't picked it up
for execution yet. If a subscription is canceled for non-payment, it almost
certainly has an outstanding invoice.

Some API methods have a parameter named `invoicePeriod`. In the case when you want
to interact with the outstanding invoice, set the value for this parameter to
"outstanding".
