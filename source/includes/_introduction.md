As in all date and time related operations, the timezone used is the timezone set
for the authenticated user. Dates are inclusive. e.g. assuming timezone for the
authenticated user is set to UTC, 2010-07-04 <= X <= 2010-08-04 is interpreted
as 2010-07-04T00:00:00+00:00 <= X <= 2010-08-04T23:59:59+00:00.
