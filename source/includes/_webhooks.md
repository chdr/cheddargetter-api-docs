# Webhooks, Reverse API, Callbacks

Yup, CheddarGetter supports custom webhooks as well as some pre-defined third
party hooks. The hook system is fault tolerant with automatic retries and
includes a management console and some other niceties at no extra charge
(ooh, burn!). Yeah, we're pretty proud of it.
