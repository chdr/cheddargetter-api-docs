# Error Messages
When the CheddarGetter API returns error messages, it does so in XML format. For example, an error from an XML method might look like this:

`<error id="1234" code="404" auxCode="">Customer not found</error>`

Errors are logged and exposed to you in the admin GUI: [https://cheddargetter.com/admin/activity/errors](https://cheddargetter.com/admin/activity/errors)

[More information about errors is available in this KB article](http://support.cheddargetter.com/kb/api-8/error-handling)
