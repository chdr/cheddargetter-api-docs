# Request/Response Format

## Authentication

Authentication is achieved via HTTP Basic Authentication.

`username: Email address of an authorized user of <%= config[:general_name] %>`
`password: Password for the authorized user`

It is recommended that you use a different user account for development accounts vs. live accounts.  It's also a good idea to use a dedicated user account just for API authentication.

## Request

The standard URL format is:
`<%= config[:general_url] %>/xml/<PATH>/productCode/<MY_PRODUCT_CODE>[/PARAMS]`

For example:
`<%= config[:general_url] %>/xml/customers/get/productCode/MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

gets all customer data for the product with `productCode=MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

and

`<%= config[:general_url] %>/xml/customers/get/code/MY_FIRST_CUSTOMER/productCode/MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

gets customer data for the customer with `code=MY_FIRST_CUSTOMER` in the product
with  `code=MY_PRODUCT_CODE`

## Response

Response format is XML.  There are three response document types: *Plans*,
*Customers*, and *Error*.  The *Plans* document is returned when interacting
with pricing plans (a simple `GET`, for example).  The *Customers* document is
returned when interacting with customers.

You may also view raw API responses within the GUI.  For example, if you're looking at your customer list:

`<%= config[:general_url] %>/admin/customers/get`

Simply change `/admin/` to `/xml/`:

`<%= config[:general_url] %>/xml/customers/get`
