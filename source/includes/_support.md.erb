# Support

If you have questions about using the <%= config[:general_name] %> API, the following support
resources are available:

## API Knowledge Base

Visit the official [<%= config[:general_name] %> API Knowledge Base](<%= config[:support_url] %>/kb/api-8).
Most answers are found within this API documentation or within the <%= config[:general_name] %>
API Knowledge Base.

## General Knowledge Base

We publish all known issues in our Knowledge Base because developers leveraging
the <%= config[:general_name] %> API best exercise the code and identify potential errors.
If you have a problem, please search the [Knowledge Base](<%= config[:support_url] %>/kb)
to see if we are already aware of the issue. If you verify an issue report does
not exist, please describe your issue in a new post with as much detail as possible.

## Public and Private Discussion

If you need help not found in the Knowledge Base, start a
[new public discussion](<%= config[:support_url] %>/discussion/new).
If your question contains sensitive information, feel free to mark the discussion
as *private*.
