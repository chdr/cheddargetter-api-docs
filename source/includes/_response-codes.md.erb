# Response Codes

## HTTP Status Codes

The <%= config[:general_name] %> API returns appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.

`400 Bad Request` | The request was invalid. An accompanying error message will explain why.
`404 Not Found` | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested, such as a user, does not exist.
`412 Precondition Failed` | The request contains POST data that is in an invalid format or required parameters are missing.
`422 Unprocessable Entity` | The gateway doesn't like the payment data. In other words, the gateway failed to process the request.
`500 Internal Server Error` | Something is broken. Please post in the support forum so the <%= config[:general_name] %> team can investigate.
`502 Bad Gateway` | Communication with the payment gateway failed. Try again later.
