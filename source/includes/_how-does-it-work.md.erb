# How Does It Work?

Our API utilizes a REST-like interface where method calls are made by sending
HTTP GET or POST requests.  Response data is returned in XML format.

The response contains an HTTP status code of 200 for a successful request.
A status code of 400 or greater is returned upon an adverse condition.
That makes handling errors quite simple.

## Ok, That's Nice But How Do I Use It?

First, I suggest reviewing our [Open Source Wrappers](#open-source-wrappers)
available for you to use.  They make integrating quite easy.

You're also welcome to write your own code to work with the API. If you have
questions about that, [we're here to help](#support).

### Sample Integration

There are just a few things to consider when planning for an integration with
the <%= config[:general_name] %> API.  We've created a KB Article on the subject based on our
own PHP wrapper. [Check it out](<%= config[:support_url] %>/kb/api-8/sample-integration-roadmap).
